## Detailed Setup and Features

This project provides a powerful solution for developers building complex applications, such as agentic systems, that interact with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers. It consists of two distinct but complementary components:

1.  **A Universal API Proxy**: A self-hosted FastAPI application that provides a single, OpenAI-compatible endpoint for all your LLM requests. Powered by `litellm`, it allows you to seamlessly switch between different providers and models without altering your application's code.
2.  **A Resilience & Key Management Library**: The core engine that powers the proxy. This reusable Python library intelligently manages a pool of API keys to ensure your application is highly available and resilient to transient provider errors or performance issues.

## Features

-   **Universal API Endpoint**: Simplifies development by providing a single, OpenAI-compatible interface for diverse LLM providers.
-   **High Availability**: The underlying library ensures your application remains operational by gracefully handling transient provider errors and API key-specific issues.
-   **Resilient Performance**: A global timeout on all requests prevents your application from hanging on unresponsive provider APIs.
-   **Efficient Concurrency**: Maximizes throughput by allowing a single API key to handle multiple concurrent requests to different models.
-   **Intelligent Key Management**: Optimizes request distribution across your pool of keys by selecting the best available one for each call.
-   **Automated OAuth Discovery**: Automatically discovers, validates, and manages OAuth credentials from standard provider directories (e.g., `~/.gemini/`, `~/.qwen/`). No manual `.env` configuration is required for supported providers.
-   **Duplicate Credential Detection**: Intelligently detects if multiple local credential files belong to the same user account and logs a warning, preventing redundancy in your key pool.
-   **Escalating Per-Model Cooldowns**: If a key fails for a specific model, it's placed on a temporary, escalating cooldown for that model, allowing it to be used with others.
-   **Automatic Daily Resets**: Cooldowns and usage statistics are automatically reset daily, making the system self-maintaining.
-   **Detailed Request Logging**: Enable comprehensive logging for debugging. Each request gets its own directory with full request/response details, streaming chunks, and performance metadata.
-   **Provider Agnostic**: Compatible with any provider supported by `litellm`.
-   **OpenAI-Compatible Proxy**: Offers a familiar API interface with additional endpoints for model and provider discovery.
-   **Advanced Model Filtering**: Supports both blacklists and whitelists to give you fine-grained control over which models are available through the proxy.

## 1. Quick Start (Windows Executable)

This is the fastest way to get started for most users on Windows.

1.  **Download the latest release** from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Mirrowel/LLM-API-Key-Proxy/releases/latest).
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  **Run `setup_env.bat`**. A window will open to help you add your API keys. Follow the on-screen instructions.
4.  **Run `proxy_app.exe`**. This will start the proxy server in a new terminal window.

Your proxy is now running and ready to use at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 2. Detailed Setup (From Source)

This guide is for users who want to run the proxy from the source code on any operating system.

### Step 1: Clone and Install

First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies into a virtual environment.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mirrowel/LLM-API-Key-Proxy.git
cd LLM-API-Key-Proxy

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mirrowel/LLM-API-Key-Proxy.git
cd LLM-API-Key-Proxy

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file to store your secret keys. You can do this by copying the example file.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Now, open the new `.env` file and add your keys.

**Refer to the `.env.example` file for the correct format and a full list of supported providers.**

The proxy supports two types of credentials:

1.  **API Keys**: Standard secret keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
2.  **OAuth Credentials**: For services that use OAuth 2.0, like the Gemini CLI.

#### Automated Credential Discovery (Recommended)

For many providers, **no configuration is necessary**. The proxy automatically discovers and manages credentials from their default locations:
-   **API Keys**: Scans your environment variables for keys matching the format `PROVIDER_API_KEY_1` (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY_1`).
-   **OAuth Credentials**: Scans default system directories (e.g., `~/.gemini/`, `~/.qwen/`) for all `*.json` credential files.

You only need to create a `.env` file to set your `PROXY_API_KEY` and to override or add credentials if the automatic discovery doesn't suit your needs.

**Example `.env` configuration:**
```env
# A secret key for your proxy server to authenticate requests.
# This can be any secret string you choose.
PROXY_API_KEY="a-very-secret-and-unique-key"

# --- Provider API Keys (Optional) ---
# The proxy automatically finds keys in your environment variables.
# You can also define them here. Add multiple keys by numbering them (_1, _2).
GEMINI_API_KEY_1="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_1"
GEMINI_API_KEY_2="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_2"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1"

# --- OAuth Credentials (Optional) ---
# The proxy automatically finds credentials in standard system paths.
# You can override this by specifying a path to your credential file.
GEMINI_CLI_OAUTH_1="/path/to/your/specific/gemini_creds.json"
```

### 3. Run the Proxy

You can run the proxy in two ways:

**A) Using the Compiled Executable (Recommended)**

A pre-compiled, standalone executable for Windows is available on the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/Mirrowel/LLM-API-Key-Proxy/releases/latest). This is the easiest way to get started as it requires no setup.

For the simplest experience, follow the **Easy Setup for Beginners** guide at the top of this document.

**B) Running from Source**

Start the server by running the `main.py` script directly.

```bash
python src/proxy_app/main.py
```

The proxy is now running and available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Make a Request

You can now send requests to the proxy. The endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions`.

Remember to:
1.  Set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer your-super-secret-proxy-key`.
2.  Specify the `model` in the format `provider/model_name`.

Here is an example using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-super-secret-proxy-key" \
-d '{
    "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
}'
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Using with the OpenAI Python Library (Recommended)

The proxy is OpenAI-compatible, so you can use it directly with the `openai` Python client.

```python
import openai

# Point the client to your local proxy
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1",
    api_key="a-very-secret-and-unique-key" # Use your PROXY_API_KEY here
)

# Make a request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash", # Specify provider and model
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about space."}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Using with `curl`

```bash
You can also send requests directly using tools like `curl`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer a-very-secret-and-unique-key" \
-d '{
    "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]
}'
```

### Available API Endpoints

-   `POST /v1/chat/completions`: The main endpoint for making chat requests.
-   `POST /v1/embeddings`: The endpoint for creating embeddings.
-   `GET /v1/models`: Returns a list of all available models from your configured providers.
-   `GET /v1/providers`: Returns a list of all configured providers.
-   `POST /v1/token-count`: Calculates the token count for a given message payload.

## 4. Advanced Topics

### How It Works

When a request is made to the proxy, the application uses its core resilience library to ensure the request is handled reliably:

1.  **Selects an Optimal Key**: The `UsageManager` selects the best available key from your pool. It uses a tiered locking strategy to find a healthy, available key, prioritizing those with the least recent usage. This allows for concurrent requests to different models using the same key, maximizing efficiency.
2.  **Makes the Request**: The proxy uses the acquired key to make the API call to the target provider via `litellm`.
3.  **Manages Errors Gracefully**:
    -   It uses a `classify_error` function to determine the failure type.
    -   For **transient server errors**, it retries the request with the same key using exponential backoff.
    -   For **key-specific issues (e.g., authentication or provider-side limits)**, it temporarily places that key on a cooldown for the specific model and seamlessly retries the request with the next available key from the pool.
4.  **Tracks Usage & Releases Key**: On a successful request, it records usage stats. The key is then released back into the available pool, ready for the next request.

### Command-Line Arguments and Scripts

The proxy server can be configured at runtime using the following command-line arguments:

-   `--host`: The IP address to bind the server to. Defaults to `0.0.0.0` (accessible from your local network).
-   `--port`: The port to run the server on. Defaults to `8000`.
-   `--enable-request-logging`: A flag to enable detailed, per-request logging. When active, the proxy creates a unique directory for each transaction in the `logs/detailed_logs/` folder, containing the full request, response, streaming chunks, and performance metadata. This is highly recommended for debugging.

**Example:**
```bash
python src/proxy_app/main.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9999 --enable-request-logging
```

#### Windows Batch Scripts

For convenience on Windows, you can use the provided `.bat` scripts in the root directory to run the proxy with common configurations:

-   **`start_proxy.bat`**: Starts the proxy on `0.0.0.0:8000` with default settings.
-   **`start_proxy_debug_logging.bat`**: Starts the proxy and automatically enables request logging.

### Troubleshooting

-   **`401 Unauthorized`**: Ensure your `PROXY_API_KEY` is set correctly in the `.env` file and included in the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header of your request.
-   **`500 Internal Server Error`**: Check the console logs of the `uvicorn` server for detailed error messages. This could indicate an issue with one of your provider API keys (e.g., it's invalid or has been revoked) or a problem with the provider's service. If you have logging enabled (`--enable-request-logging`), inspect the `final_response.json` and `metadata.json` files in the corresponding log directory under `logs/detailed_logs/` for the specific error returned by the upstream provider.
-   **All keys on cooldown**: If you see a message that all keys are on cooldown, it means all your keys for a specific provider have recently failed. If you have logging enabled (`--enable-request-logging`), check the `logs/detailed_logs/` directory to find the logs for the failed requests and inspect the `final_response.json` to see the underlying error from the provider.

### Advanced Model Filtering (Whitelists & Blacklists)

The proxy provides a powerful way to control which models are available to your applications using environment variables in your `.env` file.

#### How It Works

The filtering logic is applied in this order:

1.  **Whitelist Check**: If a provider has a whitelist defined (`WHITELIST_MODELS_<PROVIDER>`), any model on that list will **always be available**, even if it's on the blacklist.
2.  **Blacklist Check**: For any model *not* on the whitelist, the proxy checks the blacklist (`IGNORE_MODELS_<PROVIDER>`). If the model is on the blacklist, it will be hidden.
3.  **Default**: If a model is on neither list, it will be available.

This allows for two powerful patterns:

#### Use Case 1: Pure Whitelist Mode

You can expose *only* the specific models you want. To do this, set the blacklist to `*` to block all models by default, and then add the desired models to the whitelist.

**Example `.env`:**
```env
# Block all Gemini models by default
IGNORE_MODELS_GEMINI="*"

# Only allow gemini-1.5-pro and gemini-1.5-flash
WHITELIST_MODELS_GEMINI="gemini-1.5-pro-latest,gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
```

#### Use Case 2: Exemption Mode

You can block a broad category of models and then use the whitelist to make specific exceptions.

**Example `.env`:**
```env
# Block all preview models from OpenAI
IGNORE_MODELS_OPENAI="*-preview*"

# But make an exception for a specific preview model you want to test
WHITELIST_MODELS_OPENAI="gpt-4o-2024-08-06-preview"
```
